// contention an occasional page load or Livewire render overshoots Playwright's

// the ceiling costs passing tests nothing — waits resolve the moment their
// condition is met — and only absorbs those load spikes.

| project that you don't want to repeat in every file. Here you can also expose helpers as
| global functions to help you to reduce the number of lines of code in your test files.
